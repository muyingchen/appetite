Amazoogle project code

## Quick start
To set up Python virtual environment and download project requirements, run the following:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Then run the script once. 
```
./setup.sh
```

Assuming the above code ran smoothly in your local mchine, before starting the web app, under this directory, run this once. 
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
And run this to start the web app. 
```
./run.sh
```
